# K E.T.A. - A simple estimation tool to translate what K says, to what she actually means.

It is important to consider a wide variety of variables when interpreting a time of arrival for K. The most rational forumation of estimation would to generate a model. However, that's a lot of work...
>For now, we will can build a simple estimation tool based on discrete variables and survey input to generate ballpark estimate for K's eta. 

## Ke.t.a (aka STEVEstimatior)

- Enter the K-provided time estimation in hours. 
- Enter the approximate distance from final destination
- Enter key words used in initial description. 

***An adjusted time estimation in hours will then be provided.***

### Version Updates:
